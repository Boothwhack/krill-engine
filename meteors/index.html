    <h1>Krill Game Engine</h1>
    <h2>A small data-driven game engine written in <i class="fa-brands fa-rust fa-xs"></i> Rust</h2>
    <p>To the right is a recreation of a classic arcade game. Steer the spaceship with the arrow-keys and shoot with the spacebar. The game is running on the Krill engine and is capable of running in all modern browsers.</p>
    <p>From the start I have chosen to build with technologies that support compiling to a multitude of platforms. The Rust compiler has built-in support for compiling to WebAssembly, which allows for near-native performance on the web.</p>
    <p>The source code for this demo is located in the <a href="https://github.com/Boothwhack/krill-engine/tree/main/meteors" target="_blank">meteors</a> directories in the <a href="https://github.com/Boothwhack/krill-engine/" target="_blank">krill-engine</a> repository.</p>
